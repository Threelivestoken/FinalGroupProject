# FinalGroupProject
This is for our final group project. We will be making a model to play a game that is similar to the Gymnasium Frozen Lake game. We will be using symbols and letters to represent different tiles (a 0 represents empty space, an ampersand represents the character, a 1 represents a bad tile, and a 2 represents a very bad tile that will be game over).
